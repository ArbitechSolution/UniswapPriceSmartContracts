# Smart contracts

Even though all public contracts' source code will be published
on BSCscan, this repository acts as a centralized place
for people to read and review those contracts more easily.

This repository also contains official addresses of Pet Mapping's contracts.

_Note: Some contract logics are not fully decentralized as of now.
After the development is done, all those logics will be locked
so no changes can be made and full decentralization would be achieved._
